- 👋 Hi, I’m @YashShiroya
- 👀 I’m like to build technology products that in some ways I can:
  - see 👁️ (think any vanilla webpage or a complex data visualizer),
  - feel 〰 (think of a game where you play blind and navigate a course based on vibrations alone),
  - touch 👉 (think of something as everyday as an Alexa).
  - Point is... technology/software products tend to be abstract, virtual, in a fabricated world.
    - So, I like to build and be involved in things that don't let us lose touch of reality.
