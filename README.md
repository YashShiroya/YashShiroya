- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @YashShiroya
- All the code I wrote over the last 3 years has been in a private vault known as Amazon.com, Inc.
- So none of that code has translated into cells ðŸŸ© on my Github Commit Grid ðŸ˜¿.
- Currently working with a cool team developers and technologists from the *United Nations Development Programme's [SDG-AI Lab](https://sdgailab.org/)*.
